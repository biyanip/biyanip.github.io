------------
* to write a new post, make a repo on github in the lambda-oinks organization
* in posts/, git submodule add (ssh-url dir-name-locally) 
** within posts/ git push origin master
* cd into it, edit it
** to commit edits, within the posts/POSTNAME repo:
*** git status
*** git add .
*** git commit -a 
*** git push origin master
* first commit, to add the posts/POSTNAME: within the post/ repo:
** git status
** git add . 
** git commit -a  
* to publish to url and not just github, ./update.sh

==========
Agenda:
* TOC with jquery
* single page
* posts
	[x] deep learning thru server 
	[] self-confidence in programming
	[] setting up blog
[] posts in separate repo:
	[] submodule work to track head

updatepreview.sh --> cp -r ~/lambda-oinks/* ~/lambda-oinks-posts/
update.sh --> updates oinkina.github.io with _site/*

cp !(posts/*) ~/lambda-oinks-posts

lambda-oinks-preview:
* has newest lambda-oinks-blog
* has new posts

lambda-oinks-blog:
* has publishable blog

oinkina.github.io:
* just _site/ from lambda-oinks-blog

==============
ToDo for blog:


[] make footer longer for mobile (30?)
[] make image change to center if mobile
[] tags
[] teasers
[] toc like feynman lectures
[] pretty scrolly effect like nick liow's blog
[] photo buttons for archive (with bootstrap)
[] single page home page like strikingly and ballers dinner
[x] google analytics
[] mathjax
	[x] exists
	[] make it have field automatically (constField --> didn't actually load even when mathCtx came first)
	[] example works
	[] mobius transform 
[] disqus
	[x] inline comments
	[] text of "0 comments"
[x] separate repo for posts
[x] latex fonts and headers
[x] images inline
[x] footer works for small screens
[x] justify only when min tablet  
[x] code and blockquotes magnified
[x] blockquotes and its image same color as code
[x] syntax highlighting for code
[x] floating footnotes

[] hidden equations in margin - like michael's blog
	<span id="margin_654456646624" class="marginequation" style="display: none;">
  <a href="chap1.html#eqtn3" style="padding-bottom: 5px;" onMouseOver="this.style.borderBottom='1px solid #2A6EA6';" onMouseOut="this.style.borderBottom='0px';">$ 
  \sigma(z) \equiv \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$</a>
	</span>


===============================
Ideas for topics to post about:

* technical posts on neural nets and/or math
* being female in a community with a highly skewed gender ratio
* thoughts on how to learn independently 
* how I emancipated and left home (with my parents not realizing I was out of the city until weeks later)
     * issues with being under 18 and not being treated as a real person by lots of bureaucratic things 
     * issues with not being in high school
     * what it's like being financially independent at 17 and living on as little money as possible
* what it was like being religiously Jewish vs. now
* adventures I'm having - just like what my daily life is like now, and how that contrasts to what it is like for many other high school seniors and how I'm learning way more
* having fibromylagia and what that's like since it's an "invisible disease"
